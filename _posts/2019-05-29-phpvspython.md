title: PHP vs. Python for WebApps in 2019
---

I took some time to look at Python and PHP for the folks over at Stackify. This is an in-depth
dive into the two languages to determine which makes the most sense for a WebApp
these days. [Give it a read](https://stackify.com/php-vs-python-which-should-you-choose-in-2019/) if you're interested.
