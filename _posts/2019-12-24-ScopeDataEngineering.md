title: How to Scope a Data Engineering Project
---

It's easy to embark on Data Engineering projects only to find that halfway through, you're lost with no way out.
This is a common experience for many Data Engineers, but most can't or won't do the work to make sure
the project is scoped correctly before they dive in. Fortunately, that process doesn't have to be hard. I 
outline how to scope a data engineering project over at 
[DataOpsZone](https://dataopszone.com/how-to-scope-data-engineering-project/) this week.
