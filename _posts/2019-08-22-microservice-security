title: A Containerization Best Practices Guide
---

It's been a few weeks since I've had a new post to share, but there's new stuff. This week, I took some time to talk
with Sqreen about [Security traps to avoid when transitioning to a microservice](https://blog.sqreen.com/top-10-security-traps-to-avoid-when-migrating-from-a-monolith-to-microservices/).
It's a fun post, and I had a good time writing it.
